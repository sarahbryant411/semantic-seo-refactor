# semantic-seo-refactor

## The challenge was to refactor the code meets accessibility standards. Also to find semantic HTML elements. I also made it to where the elemts follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. You will find accessible alt attributes. The heading attributes will fall in sequential order. And the title element is a concise, descriptive title.
